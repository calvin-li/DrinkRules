<p>OK, this is quite different than the West Coast rules. Here on the East Coast we play like this:<br />
</p>
<p>6 Red or Blue &quot;Party Cups&quot;. Fill the beer up to the first rim on the cup (about 1/3 full). This equals 2 full beers per team. We arrange them in a pyramid (a paddle off the back of the table), 3 cups in the back, 2 in the middle row, 1 in the front, all tightly pushed together. The cups are on either end of ping pong table, or on 2 separate tables about 15 feet apart of you don't have a ping pong table. <br />
</p>
<p>Water Cup. There is cup of warm water to dip the ball in, in the event that the ball picks up something unpleasant off of the floor. <br />
  Singles or Doubles (same rules, if you're playing doubles partners rotate shots and drinks) <br />
</p>
<p>Lobs only <br />
</p>
<p>Bounces off of anything count. As soon as the ping pong ball hits something, you can smack it away so it won't bounce in. <br />
</p>
<p>Drinks occur right after the shot is made. You can't shoot back until your drink is drunk. <br />
</p>
<p>Rebuttals - After the last cup is made, the team behind gets 2 shots (one per partner) to try and rebutt. <br />
</p>
<p>Money ball. This one is definitely different. We play with 2 balls. One is white, one is yellow. One partner shoots the white ball, the other shoots the yellow ball. If you make the yellow ball, you get it right back and retain your turn. You keep getting it back as long as you make it. Teams decide which player wants to throw their money ball. You can rotate back and forth between throwing the white ball or the money ball. Whoever is on a roll typically should throw the money ball. <br />
</p>
<p>Blowing. If the ball is spinning around the cup and not yet touching the beer, female players can attempt to blow it out of the cup. Male players <br />
  can not blow the ball out of the cup in the event it is spinning. <br />
</p>
<p>Streaking. If one team didn't make a shot the entire game, first they finish the other teams' beers. Then they proceed to take off their clothes <br />
  and streak 1 time around the house/apartment. <br />
</p>
<p>These are the University of Virginia rules, where we take our beer pong seriously. A lot of frats/apartments have rooms dedicated to the game, and it is called &quot;the pong room&quot;. The room is usually decorated with job rejection letters....etc<br />
</p>
<p>These rules are quite similar throughout most colleges in Virginia (I've seen the same at Virginia Tech and James Madison, and in Washington DC. The money ball is a UVA rule...haven't seen that one anywhere else.</p>
