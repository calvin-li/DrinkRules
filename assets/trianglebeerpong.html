<p><strong>MATERIALS</strong><br />
</p>
<p>1. 26 cups (2 triangles of 6 cups on each side, 2 wash cups) <br />
  2. 2 balls<br />
  3. A F'N lot of beer<br />
  4. Table: approximately. 3'x6'<br />
</p>
<p>Rules of engagement (shots are thrown by hand, can be either bounce or air)</p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
<p><br />
  1. First throw is tossed by challenging/losing team ( team B)<br />
</p>
<p>A. If ball goes in, other team (team A) has chance to match<br />
</p>
<p>B. If team A matches, both teams drink cup fast as possible and attempt to make shot before other team. NOW its open table<br />
</p>
<p>If team A makes cup, team B must give ball back as fast as possible, while drinking the made cup as fast as possible <br />
</p>
<p>A. Team A has option of throwing ball before team B is finished drinking ,or, <br />
</p>
<p>B. Wait for team B to finish drinking. &quot;While Team B is drinking&quot;: ( 2 scenario's) <br />
  -Team A makes shot- get both balls back -Team A misses shot- get one ball back <br />
  &quot;throughout duration of game&quot;<br />
</p>
<p>A. missed shots are open balls: meaning- PLAYERS ARE ENCOURAGED <br />
</p>
<p>TO WRESTLE/FIGHT FOR BALL until ball is in possession of either team <br />
</p>
<p>Once either teams cups are reduced to a total amount of 6 cups, cups are then put together in one pyramid <br />
</p>
<p>Knocked over cups are count as made cups, but team does not get ball back <br />
</p>
<p>Last shot, once the final cup is made,. there is a redemption shot,: losing team is aloud to shoot ball until they miss, only one player can take this shot <br />
</p>
<p>A. if each team has only one cup left, game goes into match mode: meaning once a ball is made, the other team has to match it,. this goes on <br />
  until shot is missed <br />
</p>
<p>Losing team drinks winning teams beer <br />
