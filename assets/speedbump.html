<p>This is a one person game. Someone deals eight cards face down layed out in a row and places the shot glass in the middle; so there is four cards on each side of the shot. Fill the shot, this is the speed bump.<br />
</p>
<p>Now, the player starts flipping up the cards starting on either end of the row. If the card is from 2 to 10 then the player keeps going. If the card is a Jack the player must drink 1 and the dealer places 1 card face down in that spot. If the card drawn is a Queen then it is 2 drinks and 2 cards. 3 for Kings and 4 four Aces. Note that the row can grow to more than eight cards.<br />
</p>
<p>Now, anytime the player goes over the speed bump then they must drink it. That includes going backwards. Example: If the player draws a queen on the card past the speed bump then he/she drinks 2, gets two more cards, drinks the shot, and now must go over the speed bump again!!<br />
  Player wins when he gets to the end of the row.</p>
