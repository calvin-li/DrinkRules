<p><strong>Materials:</strong><br />
  . 14 cups<br />
  . 4 ping pong balls<br />
  . Evenly divide a billion beers . 2-4 players<br />
  . Loud music<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Rules:</strong><br />
</p>
<p>There are two styles to play with that should be decided on at the beginning of the game.<br />
  Make it take it - If a player makes a shot, the ball is returned for another shot till the player misses. <br />
</p>
<p>Team Play - Both players have to sink a shot in to return the ball back for another <br />
  shot. Make it take it does not apply. <br />
</p>
<p>Picking teams -<br />
  If players have conflicts with who will be on what team, names are pulled out of a hat. The first two names are on a team, the second two names are on a team, and so on and so forth. After a team wins a tournament or series, names will be drawn again for new teams. <br />
</p>
<p>Two pyramids of 6 cups on each side of the table, with washing cups on either side for when the ball hits the ground. <br />
</p>
<p>To start out players from team A and B say &quot;1, 2, 3 shoot&quot; and throw one ball each. You can choose to hold your ball and wait for the opposing team to shoot their ball. You do not have to drink if a cup is sunk with a<br />
  starting ball. First team to make a shot goes first. <br />
</p>
<p>Winning team always shoots first, unless you are playing one on one, in which case you shoot for first shot every game played.<br />
</p>
<p>After the starting shot each team shoots 2 balls at a time, if a cup is sunk the opposing team must drink immediately. If a shot is made, the ball is returned to the player until he/she misses.<br />
</p>
<p>The player must finish all beer dealt to him/her, before throwing the ball.<br />
</p>
<p>Rearrange - 4 cup is a diamond, 3 cup is a triangle, 2 cups right in front of each other.<br />
</p>
<p>Live ball - If the ball bounces off the table, or on the rim of a cup, or any other object you are allowed to swat the ball away.<br />
</p>
<p>No blowing. Only girls are allowed to blow.<br />
</p>
<p>If someone knocks a beer over, they drink the rest of the beer and chug a new beer too.<br />
</p>
<p>If someone swats a players shot they automatically throw the game for there team and are LOSERS!!<br />
</p>
<p>If a player throws the ball into there own cup, they drink that cup and lose there turn.<br />
</p>
<p>If a player drops the ball twice while attempting to shoot, they lose their turn.<br />
</p>
<p>If a player shoots with his/her foot over the throwing line, they lose their turn and drink one of there own cups off the table.<br />
</p>
<p>Once a player is up on the line to shoot, they have 15 sec's to shoot, or &quot;delay of game is called&quot;, and that person loses their turn.<br />
</p>
<p>Taunting and name calling is approved. Players can wave hands over cups but may not cover the view of the cups.<br />
</p>
<p>Redemption - After a team has sunk all 6 cups, the opposing team gets one <br />
  shot a piece to make in the rest of the cups. If the player makes it the ball is returned for another shot. If losing team makes the rest of there cups in one turn, you go into overtime. Three cups are placed on each side of the table, filling the three cups with a beer per side. <br />
</p>
<p>Losing team always gets beer for the winning team. <br />
</p>
<p>Anyone who wins a tournament takes over the title &quot;Beer pong pimp master of the world&quot;. </p>
