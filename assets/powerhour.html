<p>The game's rules appear simple; however, players often have difficulty completing the specified number of drinks as the rate of consumption necessary to win many forms of this game can, depending on the player's weight and other factors, raise their blood alcohol content to high levels. The rate of alcohol consumption makes the players intoxicated within a short period of time. The rules for this game are for reference only and due to the excessive levels of alcohol consumption involved, should NEVER be played!</p>
<p>Each shot of beer contains 1.5 fluid ounces (US) (44mL), for a total of 90 fl. oz. (5.63 US pints, 2.66 litres, or 4.68 Imperial units pints) of consumption during the power hour. For purposes of blood alcohol content, this amount of beer is equivalent to 7.5 drinks. In the Centurion variant, beer shots are drunk one per minute for 100 minutes, with a shot size of 35mL, totaling 7.4 US pints (3.5 litres or 6.16 Imperial pints), or 9.9 drinks. There are many difficult variants of Centurion, amongst them are Gladiator and Spartan. Gladiator is 200 shots of beer in 200 minutes, and Spartan is 300 shots in 300 minutes.</p>
