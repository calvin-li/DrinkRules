<p><em>The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</em> may have dented the man in the hat's reputation, but we still love our Indy.</p>
<p>Whichever of the four films you choose, they're all so driven by familiar, iconic images, you'll probably be necking your drink throughout.</p>
<p><strong>THE RULES</strong></p>
<p>Drink Every Time...</p>
<p>- The Paramount logo match-cuts into something<br />
  - Indy reaches for his gun.  Take another drink if his gun isn't there;<br />
  - Indy nearly loses his hat, whip or other accessory<br />
  - The whip is used<br />
  - Indy's progress across the world is shown on a map<br />
  - There's a genuine moment of archaeology<br />
  - A mythic artefact is found<br />
  - Denholm Elliott is seen<br />
  - A foreign language is subtitled<br />
  - Indy gets punched<br />
  - Indy gets chased<br />
  - A snake is seen<br />
