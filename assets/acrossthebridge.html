<p>Deal out ten cards face down in one line. This forms the bridge. The object is to get across the bridge. You do this by flipping over one card at a time.<br />
</p>
<p>If you get a numbered card you are fine and get to move to the next card. However, if you flip a face card you drink according to the face card, Jack is one, Queen is two, King is three, and Ace is four. If you flip a face card, you must put down more cards according to what the face card is.<br />
</p>
<p>Example: Pull a Jack and place one more down, pull a Queen and put two down, etc. Once all the cards are flipped over or the deck is done you are across, and you are done.</p>
