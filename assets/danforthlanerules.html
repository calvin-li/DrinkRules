<p>1. Cups are located 12-18 inches from the back edge of the table <br />
</p>
<p>2. If playing doubles, cups are on the center line, if fours, cups are centered in the respective quadrant (beer stains on table should help with location). <br />
</p>
<p>3. Players are not allowed to strike the ball until it has passed the cups (also known as the no defense rule). <br />
</p>
<p>4. If the ball hits the cup, person whose cup was hit takes one sip. </p>
<p>5. If the ball lands in the cup, person whose cup the ball is in drinks all remaining beer in cup. Ball cannot be removed first. <br />
</p>
<p>6. Player stays on table until someone puts a ball in their cup (or they pass out).<br />
</p>
<p>7. Cannot hit opponents cup, or put in opponents cup on serve. <br />
</p>
<p>8. Ball is in play unless it has hit a cup or gone in a cup, or in the net. <br />
</p>
