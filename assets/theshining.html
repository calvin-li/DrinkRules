<p>Lazydork is the Wikipedia of movie drinking games, a dedicated resource with hundreds of titles available, including their take on The Shining.</p>
<p>Choosing Stanley Kubrick's chiller feels wrong, somehow - after all, it's the tale of an alcoholic falling off the wagon and trying to murder his family.</p>
<p>And yet The 'Dork's game is a celebration of all those stylistic quirks that make it such an effective scare-story.</p>
<p><strong>THE RULES</strong></p>
<p>Drink Every Time:</p>
<p>- Room 237 is shown or mentioned<br />
  - Tony is referenced<br />
  - A titlecard is used<br />
  - Jack's writing is shown or mentioned<br />
  - The weather is referenced<br />
  - Anyone says &quot;Torrance&quot;</p>
<p>AND IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET WASTED . . .<br />
  Anytime anyone sees something or someone that isn't really there.</p>
