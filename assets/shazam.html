<p>The rules of this game are pretty simple. It works best with at least 4 people. You sit around a table or in a circle and spread out the cards in the middle. Someone goes first and picks a card and follows these instructions.<br />
  <br />
  Heart- Person to right drinks the Value<br />
  Diamond- Person to the left drinks the Value<br />
  Spade- Give out the Value to whomever<br />
  Club- Drink the Value<br />
  <br />
  Ace's are 1 drink in this game, and up, with Jacks 11, Queens 12...<br />
  <br />
  Now this is where the Shazam comes in...<br />
  <br />
  When you draw a King, you say the word Shazam, and everyone toasts the middle. Then you do the suit and value stuff with the Shazam card(King) being 15 drinks</p>
