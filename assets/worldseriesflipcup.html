      <h4>Standard Game Rules</h4>
      <p>Teams will consist of 6 people to compete. There are no gender requirements at all for this tournament. Each team has the option to bring alternates/reserves and is limited to only 2 alternates/reserves, for a total of 8 players. If a team has alternates, they can only make line-up changes in between matches. The 6 players that start a match have to be the same that finish it. (a match is defined as a best of 7 series) If a team does not have the minimum 6 players they will be given an automatic 0-4 loss.</p>
      <p>16oz clear plastic cups will be used for the WSOFC. A standard match consists of 6 players per team. Each player will fill their cup with a small amount of beverage of their choice.</p>
      <p>Game play:<br />
        Designate one end of the table as the starting end, and the other as the anchor end. The first player at the starting side will be assigned cup #1 and so on down the line. The game starts when both player #1′s tap each other&rsquo;s cup and then tap the table. Also known as &ldquo;The Gentleman&rsquo;s Start.&rdquo; From there each player #1 will drink the amount of beverage in the cup. Then they will place the cup FACE UP on the edge of the table and proceed to flip the cup until it lands 100% FACE DOWN. Then player #2 can drink their beverage and proceed to flip, and so on down the line until all team members have flipped. The first team to flip all of their cups wins that game. The next game will start with player #2 being the new starter and player #1 being the new anchor. There is no need to move any player locations on the table.</p>
      <p>If 2 cups on opposing sides land at the same time you go to a tie breaker known as JUNGLE RULES (see below). Remember, if 2 cups hit the table at the same time, it is the cup that settles first that wins. The matches will be a &ldquo;best of 7″ games format. The first team to 4 game victories wins.</p>
      <h4>Jungle Rules</h4>
      <p>Jungle Rules is when everyone at the table participates at the same time. The entire table will Gentleman&rsquo;s Start with their opposite cup #, then everyone will flip. The first team to have every team member flip their cup will win.</p>
      <h4>Pool Tie Breakers</h4>
      <p>In the case that multiple teams have the same pool record and are tied for the final spot to reach the 16 team bracket, we will now be using a tie breaking system. The system will determine the top team with the following criteria.</p>
      <p>Head to head (only valid if 2 teams are tied for the final spot)<br />
        Record against common opponents<br />
        Record against #1 seed<br />
        Record against #2 seed<br />
        Margin of victory against common opponents<br />
        Total Margin of victory<br />
        If we don&rsquo;t have an answer by then, a good old coin toss will do</p>
      <h4>Cheating</h4>
      <p>If two hands are used to flip or guide the cup it, is an illegal flip. Only one hand is permitted to make the flip. The non-flipping hand may act strictly as balance assistance for the cup on the edge of the table. Sometimes you are forced to play on tables with &ldquo;less than ideal&rdquo; edges, so it is necessary for added support. This in no way is meant to help guide the cup during the flip; just to keep it from falling off of the table. Also the non flipping hand must remain completely still during the flip if it is used for balance assistance. This will eliminate any debate about it being used as a guide. The only time contact with the cups by 2 hands is allowed is to place the cup on the edge or to re-set the cup if a complete flip is not made.</p>
      <p>Also, the cup base must be touching the table top when the flip is made. There are no &ldquo;mid air&rdquo; flips.</p>
      <p>A player may not intentional interfere with the other teams cups or flipping process.</p>
      <p>For all illegal flips or infractions, a warning will be given upon the first offense. A loss of the current game will be given up each additional offense.</p>
