<p>This one's for all you Texas hold 'em poker players. You need chips or some kind of counters, no money is involved. You bet as usual, using blinds or antes.</p>
<p>If you fold before the flop, you take one drink/sip. If you fold after the flop, you take two. Three drinks if you fold after the turn and four if you fold after the river. If you stay in and lose the hand, you drink five.</p>
<p>The winner gets all the chips in the pot, but may dish out any many as he/she wants to other players, each chip representing a drink/sip. The recipients of the chips keep them and may play them. The advantage of keeping your chips is that, if you ever lose all your chips at any time, you must chug a full drink.</p>
