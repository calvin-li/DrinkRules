<p><strong>Here are the rules from a school in Lafayette - The spiritual birthplace of beer pong.</strong> <br />
</p>
<p><strong>Cup location</strong> - singles - paddles length in from rear on center line. doubles - paddles length in from rear and one in from each side<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Points/Drinks</strong> - A hit of the cup by the opponent is a point - one drink taken. A dunk or a knock over are 5 points each - fill up and chug. 5 drinks to a cup. Cups are 12oz. plastic - F&amp;K brand is good.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Misc. drinks</strong> - double fault, hitting yourself, hitting opponent on a serve - a drink is taken but not a point (called an &quot;over&quot; and kept track of separately instead). Likewise dunking or knocking yourself over or dunking or knocking over an opponent on serve is fill up and chug for you - and 5 over, no points.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Drinking</strong> - each drink should be relatively proportional to give your opponent a chance to knock you over, but on your last drink left, beer can not be higher than ball's height in the cup.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Score</strong> - Play is to 21. Must win by 2.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Serving</strong> - a valid serve hits both sides at least once - anything else in the middle (hitting wall, net, extra bounces etc.) does not affect serve's legality. After any drink (point or over) the person or team who drank serves.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Play</strong> - Virtually anything is in play - including all surfaces (floor, walls, ceiling). Only one hit per time on your side of the table/your side of the net. You cannot hit the ball on the table till it passes a line even with your cup. Off the table it need only pass onto your side of the net. You may never block the ball from hitting your cup, though you may blow it out of the way (or fan it with the paddle). Off the table you may block the ball with your body, but not advance it forward with your body (to the side is okay). Play continues till a drink occurs or till you are given the ball back to serve if you did not hit your opponents side of the table with your shot (your opponent may still play this as previously said, but he doesn't have to) or if you decide to serve it yourself (for example, your opponent did hit your side and how the ball is dead in a corner of the floor, and you have no shot you care to take). </p>
<p>If you hit the ball and it bounces off the rear wall of your opponent and comes back to your side, you may hit it again. If it didn't make it to the rear wall and comes back without your opponent touching it, you can not play it, and serve is determined by who last did not hit the table (opponenet's side of the table that is).<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Options</strong> - If your opponent hits a bad first or second serve, or hits himself or in some other way gives himself an 'over', and you have a playable shot, you may call &quot;Option&quot; before hitting the ball, and then do so. Play continues from there. The over or bad serve is erased (no drink taken). Special case - If you have one drink left and double fault, your opponent has the option of whether you drink/ take the over or not. If he elects for you not to drink (what is typically done) and you hit a third consecutive bad serve, you must drink half of what was in your cup, then keep serving with the &quot;bad serve counter&quot; reset from there.<br />
  Doubles - No need to rotate shots or sides - play is same as in singles. All drinks are done equally by both teammates (i.e. - on a point, both players of a team must drink).</p>
