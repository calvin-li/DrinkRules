<p>A game of fierce skill in the land of the very high buzz. You're going to need two card tables, ping pong balls, and of course, beer.<br/>
</p>
<p>Set up the card tables on opposite sides of a room, the farther apart, the greater the challenge. Place a cup of beer on the far table for each player. </p>
<p>Each player takes turns bouncing a ball off the near table trying to land the ball in the cup on the far table. If a player bounces a ball that does not make it to the opposite table, that player must drink from his/her beer. If a player is successful in landing the ball in an opponents cup, the opponent must immediately bounce a ball into the cup of the successful player. If unsuccessful in the match, that person must drink the entire cup of beer with the ball in it. But, if the challenger is successful, the first player must drink his entire beer. </p>
<p>If you ever land the ball in your own cup, you must drink the entire beer with the ball in it. </p>
