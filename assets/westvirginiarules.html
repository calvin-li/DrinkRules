Very long and wide table, 4 people each have their own set of 6 cups. One person on the north side, south side, east side and west side of the table,<br />
<p>Each person starts with a ball, you can throw at the persons cups directly across from you, and bounce to the people to the left and right of you, however bounces do not take away two cups just one, full contact rebounds.<br />
</p>
<p>Throw some elbows! Last person to remain with all cups wins, very fast pace and very fun when extremely intoxicated... <br />
</p>
<p>Post this set of rules on your web site, they are very rare, thanks! </p>
