<p>Please, don't take the title too literally.  It's just an excuse to watch Bruce Willis' finest two hours yet again.</p>
<p>We're using  Last Broadcast's excellent game as the basis, but with a few rule-changes so we can stick to the masterful original. </p>
<p><strong>THE RULES</strong></p>

<p>- Anyone uses a radio or walkie-talkie to communicate.<br />
