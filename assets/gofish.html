<p>Play the game as you always have, except:</p>
<p>- If you ask somebody for a card and they don't have it...take a sip...and go fish.</p>
<p>- If you &quot;go fish&quot; and you &quot;fish your wish&quot;, make the person you asked drink double the card number.</p>
<p>- If you ask somebody for a card and they do have it, that person has to drink the number on the card.</p>
