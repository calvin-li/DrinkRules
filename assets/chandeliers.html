  <h2><span id="Set_up">Set up</span></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A shot glass is filled with liquor and put in the center of the table.</li>
    <li>Larger glasses (one for each player) are also filled with beer, arranged around the center glass in a circle, and in front of the respective players.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><span id="Game_play">Game play</span></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The player in possession of the quarter bounces it on the table, trying to land it in a cup.</li>
    <li>If the quarter misses, it's the next player's turn.
      <ul>
        <li>If the quarter lands in that player's cup, he/she drinks it(alt. he/she chooses).</li>
        <li>If the quarter lands in another player's cup, the player whose glass it lands in has to drink the beer, and refill his/her glass.</li>
        <li>If the quarter lands in the small center glass, every player has to chug the beer in his/her large glass, and the last to set down his/her empty glass must also drink the liquor in the center glass.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The quarter is then passed to the next player.</li>
    <li>Hands Rule
      <ul>
        <li>One hand is a drinking hand, the other is a throwing hand.</li>
        <li>Drinking hand must be on the table at all times except;
          <ul>
            <li>when drinking from own glass or the middle glass.</li>
            <li>after calling 'hands' to leave the game or get a quarter</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If drinking hand is lifted off the table, he/she must drink own cup and refill.</li>
        <li>Drinking hand is used to grab own glass when the center cup is made.</li>
        <li>You may not change hands from drinking to throwing at any point during the game.</li>
        <li>Throwing hand can not be used for drinking at any point.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Whoever drinks a glass must refill it.</li>
    <li>The game can also be played with plastic cups and a ping pong ball. In this variation, when the ball lands in the center glass, every player has to chug the beer in his/her cup and then proceed to play flip-cup with it. The last player to flip his/her cup must drink the center glass. </li>
