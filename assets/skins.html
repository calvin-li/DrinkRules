<p>Shuffle a deck of cards, and go around a circle of 2-10 people. More people if you want.</p>
<p>The first person says high or low, where low is a 2-8 and high is a 9-ace. Someone pulls a card from the deck, and if they're wrong they have to take a drink.</p>
<p>If the person is right, then it goes to the next person as two &quot;skins&quot;, and he/she guesses high or low. If they're wrong then they take two drinks. If their right, then it goes to the third person with 3 skins...etc...</p>
<p>Once someone is wrong and takes their shots, then it starts over with one skin. It's kind of like the golf game &quot;skins&quot;.</p>
