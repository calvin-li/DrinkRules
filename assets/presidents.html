  <p>This is a slightly more complex game, but very, very fun when mastered. This game requires a minimum of 5 people to play. High boot factor. </p>
  <p>The first hand of asshole is the establishing hand. This will decide who is the President, VP, Normal People, and the Asshole for the next round. </p>
  <p>Approximately 6 or 7 cards are dealt to each player, depending on the number playing this can be higher or lower. The rank of the cards is as follows (most powerful to least powerful) 2, A, K, Q, ... 4, and 3. </p>
  <p>Some is chosen to go first and they play a card, the next person has two options: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>to play a card higher than (but not the same) as the previous card. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>or to pass on that turn. </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>For example, if a 4 is lead, a next player must play HIGHER than a 4, the the next player has to play higher than that. A new hand starts when all players pass, or when someone plays a 2 (the most powerful card). The last person to play a card, leads the next hand. </p>
  <p>This proceeds until all players are rid of their cards. The first player out of cards is the President for the next round, the next out becomes the VP, the next players out are normal, and the last person out is the Asshole. However lets say that the person leading has two 5's, this person may play them both, then the next player must play two of the same card HIGHER than five; this player cannot play one card or three cards, only two. As well, </p>

        <p>three, or even four, of the same card may be lead. The only time a player may lay one card in a situation like this is if it is a two (the power card); a single two, beats everything, and the hand ends followed by a new lead. </p>
        <p>The roles for each player are as follows: President: </p>
        <p>can make any player drink at any time, no-one may make the President drink but self. The President is the first player to start each round (benefits of power). And the President should never have to refill own beer. </p>
        <p>Vice President: </p>
        <p>can make any player drink at any time (except Pres), the only the President or self can make the VP drink. The VP goes second in each round.<br/>
          Normal People: </p>
        <p>These players can make each other drink as well as the Asshole. They play in the order they finished the previous round; first normal out follows the VP, second normal out follows first, etc. </p>
        <p>Asshole:<br/>
          for many reasons, this player is truly the Asshole. This player has to do all dealing of cards, all sweeping of cards after the hands, and can not make any other player drink. The asshole plays last in each round. </p>
        <p>A few recommendations, at the end of each round, the players should move seats in order to reflect the hierarchy, and proper playing order. Play your lowest cards first. Abuse the power when President or VP, but remember it will always come back to haunt you, especially when abusing the Asshole. </p>
