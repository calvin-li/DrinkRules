<p>The game is pretty simple, one person is the dealer for everyone. Going around the table, everyone takes turns guessing numerical values of cards, from 2 all the way up to aces, which equal 14. If a person guesses wrong, they drink the difference between the card and thier guess, in seconds(a guess of 5, with a 10 coming up = 5 seconds).</p>
<p>If a person guesses correct, they get to give out double the amount(a guess of 10 would = 20 seconds given away).</p>
<p>The games ends when the deck is gone. Different rules can be made up for someone who guesses correctly (ex. triple the amount).</p>
