  <strong>How to play:<br />
  </strong><br />
  Lay out a full deck of cards (minus jokers) in a circle around any item (IE Ashtray, bottle, etc)<br />
  Who ever shuffled will be the dealer, and the person to his/her left starts.<br />
  They draw any card they want, and reveal their card to the other players.<br />
  The game is over when people start puking, out of beer, people wuss out.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Card Value:<br />
  </strong><br />
  Ace - Toast followed by a drink by everyone.<br />
  <br />
  2-6 Black (Club/Spade) - Drawer drinks the card value.<br />
  <br />
  2-6 Red (Diamond/Heart) - Drawer picks to give all/part of the cards value to other players to drink.<br />
  <br />
  7 - Waterfall (Waterfall is as follows:  The drawer starts chugging, and everyone else must to. Once the drawer stops, the person to his/her left may stop drinking, or continue drinking to make the other players to his/her right keep drinking. This keeps going till the last person stops drinking.)<br />
  <br />
  8 - Thumb Master (Thumb Master is as follows: Who ever is crowned the Thumb Master can put his/her Thumb(s) on the table at ANY time. By doing so, everyone else must. The last person to put their thumb on the table has to drink.)<br />
  <br />
  9 - Rhyme - Drawer says a sentence, and the following person must make a Rhyme from the last word the drawer used. (Example: Drawer says '<em>The dog is blue</em>' then the next player can say <em>'I have to poo</em>') First person to miss has to drink.<br />
  <br />
  10 - Category - Drawer gets to pick a Category and everyone takes turns going through saying a word related to it, who ever misses must drink. (Example: Drawer picks <strong>Family Guy</strong>. The next person must say something like, <strong>Meg</strong>, then the next person must continue with something like, <strong>Brian</strong>. etc.)<br />
  <br />
  Jack - All guys drink.<br />
  <br />
  Queen - All Girls drink.<br />
  <br />
