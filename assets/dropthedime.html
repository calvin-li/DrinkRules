<p>To play this game you will need a cigarette, a glass, a napkin, and a dime. Unfold the napkin and place it over the mouth of the glass so that it will stay in place (may need to secure with tape or rubber band). Then place the dime in the center of the napkin. The object is to see how much of the napkin you can burn away, taking turns, with the cigarette. The player to cause the dime to drop consumes a full glass of beer. </p>
