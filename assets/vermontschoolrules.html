<p><strong>Materials:</strong><br />
</p>
<p>24 16oz solo party cups (no water cups cause we're not girls) 2 Ping-pong balls<br />
  8 12oz Beers per game<br />
  a 8' long x 4' wide x 36&quot; high table<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Main Rules:</strong></p>
<p>1. Set up the cups in the following fashion. Each side gets 2 6 cup triangles that are placed approximately 18&quot; apart and 2 - 3 inches from the back edge of the table.<br />

  2. Fill each cup to the first line. This is exactly 1/3 of a beer, hence each beer should fill 3 cups.<br />
</p>
<p>3. Get a partner, this is a 2 on 2 game.<br />
</p>
<p>4. The team to shoot first in the first game of the night is decided by rock-paper-scissors. The best out of 3 games wins. In every subsequent game, the team who won the last game has first shot.<br />
</p>
<p>5. The team with the balls shoots(tosses) at the opposing team's cups. If they make a cup, the opponents drink that cup. If they make both shots, they get both balls back and shoot again until they miss one or both of their shots.<br />
</p>
<p>6. Before the next team shoots, they must drink all the cups that have been made against them. Each teammate only drinks from their own pyramid. If you shoot without finishing your beer, you forfeit your shot and give the other team the ball.<br />
</p>
<p>7. When a team makes their opponent's last cup, the game is over, there are no rebuttals because those are for girls as well. The winning team stays on the table and the losing team signs up to play again.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Additional Rules:</strong><br />
</p>
<p>1. No blowing the ball out of the cup if it is spinning in the cup.<br />
</p>
<p>2. You may smack the ball away after it bounces once off of anything. However, if you smack the ball and it still goes in your cup, that counts as a made shot.<br />
</p>
<p>3. NO RE-RACKS - leave the cup formations how they are.<br />
</p>
<p>4. If you think one of your opponents cups are below the first line on the cup, you may call that cup out after you hit the rim of it and miss. If the beer is low, they must drink that cup. However, if you call the cup out and it is above the line, then drink one of your cups.<br />
</p>
<p>5. In order for someone to take a &quot;guest shot,&quot; everyone in the game must agree for this to happen.</p>
