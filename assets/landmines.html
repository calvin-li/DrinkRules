<h2>Setup Instructions</h2>
<p>Everyone that's playing needs to stand around a table.</p>
<h2>Game Requirements</h2>
<p>A few people, a glass, a quarter, and canned beer.</p>
<h2>How To Play</h2>
<p>The first person pours as much beer as they want into the glass, they then spin the quarter, they must chug the beer and pick up the quarter with their index and middle finger before it stops spinning, if they fail to finish the beer or mess up picking up the quarter they go again.</p>
<p>When someone finishes their beer they use the can as a &quot;landmine&quot;, meaning when someone else goes they can slam the can on that person’s quarter, causing them to go again, and the can stays on that spot on the table. This process continues to go around.</p>
<h2>Additions</h2>
<p>It is good to block people in their own spots with cans so that they continually mess up, and keep drinking</p>
