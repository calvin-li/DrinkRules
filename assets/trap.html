<p>This game requires at least 4 people and a deck of cards. All players sit in a circle or around a table. Someone then deals out all of the cards.<br />
</p>
<p>Once all of the cards are dealt out, the player who has the ace of spades lays it down. If the player to the left of this person does not have another ace to match this, that player drinks. That person is now trapped between the person on the left and right of them. These players try and lay down cards they think the person in the middle does not have. For each card the trapped player does not have, they drink.<br />
</p>
<p>When they finally have a card, they lay this card down and if the person next to them does not have this card then they are now trapped and so on.<br />
</p>
<p>Once a player goes out, all of the other players have to drink one drink for every card left in thier hand.</p>
