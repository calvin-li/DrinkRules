<p>Everyone sits around a table with a large glass of beer in the center and two shot glasses at opposite ends. Try to bounce the qaurter in the shot glass just like the Quarters game. Take as many shots as needed. When made pass the shot glass to the left.</p>
<p>Eventually both shot glasses will come to someone. That person must drink the middle glass and fill for the next game. Easy and adds more tension then quarters. This game gets people who suck at quarters messed up.</p>
