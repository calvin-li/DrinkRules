<p><strong>You need</strong>: Beer, a long table, plastic cups, and at least 6 people. </p>
<p><strong>Teams</strong>: You divide everyone up evenly into two teams. The maximum per team should be about 5 or 6 people. If you have more than 10 or 12 people, create several different teams and have a tournament. </p>
<p><strong>Rules</strong>: The two teams line up on opposite sides of the table. Everyone gets a cup and a beer. Fill the bottom of your cup with about two shots beer. </p>
<p>The people at the far end of the table starts. Someone says go, and you chug the cup with beer. When you are finished, you have to flip your cup before the next person can go. </p>
<p>You flip your cup by placing it on the edge of the table, right side up, half of the cup off the table. The you put your fingers under the part hanging off the table, and flip the cup so that it is upside down on the table. This gets harder as the game goes on and you get more drunk. </p>
<p>When you have completed this, the next person goes, and does the same thing. The first team to have all players drink and flip their cups wins. They then get one point. You can play to whatever number you want to. </p>
