<p>Movie Cynics offers a nice line in drinking games.  Their take on QT's colour-coded breakthrough is particularly sharp thanks to the interactive ensemble option.</p>
<p><strong>THE RULES</strong></p>
<p>Drink Every Time . . .</p>
<p>- Someone says a color<br />
  - Someone says &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo;<br />
  - Someone says &ldquo;fuck&rdquo; or any form of the word<br />
  - Someone smokes</p>
<p>The Ensemble Challenge: Write down all the names of the characters on slips of paper. Pick a name out of a hat. Whenever someone says the name of your character, take three drinks. Whenever your character dies, kill your beer and draw another name from the hat. Take a drink if your character swears, smokes, or drinks.</p>
