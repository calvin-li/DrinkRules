<h3><span id="Variations_and_other_rules">Variations and other rules</span></h3>
<p>Like almost all other drinking games, Kings has endless variations of  rules. It is not common to play Kings exactly the same when playing  with new people. There will be similar rules, but there will most likely  always be some you've never heard of. These rules below are some of the  other popular rules not covered in the common rules. Many of these  rules are used with the &quot;King – Make a Rule&quot; rule. You can also replace  some of the common rules you do not like with these. Kings is not a  competitive game. Some people have completely different rules for the  cards drawn. As long as everyone knows what the cards mean before the  game starts, then it doesn't matter what rules are being used.</p>
<h3><span id="Game_variations">Game variations</span></h3>
<ul>
  <li>A major variation in the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand or  Canada is that the contents of the King's Cup are drunk by the player  who breaks the circle of cards (known as the Ring of Fire in the UK).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>If playing with a full can of beer in the middle you must give  gaggles, after each player draws a card s/he places it under the tab on  the can, when a player's card pops the can open, that player must chug  the can. In this situation, when a King is drawn the player makes a  rule.</li>
