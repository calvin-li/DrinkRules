<p>If you drink beer while playing beerpong, drink in moderation and stay in control. This keeps it fun for everyone. <br />
</p>
<p>Lobs only (strictly enforced, not like regular ping pong. Each ball should have a solid 2-3 foot arc). Winning shots which aren't lobs don't count. <br />
  Re-do the point. <br />
</p>
<p>Cups go in the corners of the table (paddle in from the side and back of the table) <br />
</p>
<p>Hoops in the cup = The person who got hooped has to drink a designated amount of beer (determined before the game starts). <br />
</p>
<p>Hits on the cup, but not in the cup = one sip. <br />
</p>
<p>The point is never over until the ball is hit off the table, or it bounces twice. A hit on the cup does not count as a bounce (i.e. hit the cup then hit the table, you can still hit it back before it bounces on the table a second time) <br />
</p>
<p>All drinks (an accumulation of hits) occur after the point is over. <br />
</p>
<p>The team hooped has the opportunity to throw the ball back into their opponents cup (either one) from their side of the table (don't lean in too much). If the throwback is successful, the person throwing back gets to decide if both teams drink, or if the drinks are cancelled. Also, if the throwback is successful, the other team gets the opportunity to throw back, thus nullifying the original throwback, and so on. <br />
</p>
<p>Doubles - partners rotate shots (just like regular ping pong). <br />
</p>
<p>Singles - cups go into center of table (paddle in from edge). <br />
</p>
<p>Must win by 2 points. <br />
</p>
<p>Play to 21 or 11 if others are waiting to get on the table </p>
<p><strong>Additional Rules</strong></p>
<p>Stoners: If the ball skips off the edge of the table before the other team can get a paddle on it, its declared a &quot;Stoner&quot;. Although the team who made the stoner still gets the point, they have to drink once since they got such a cheap ass point. <br />
</p>
<p>Space: If you forget the scores, or forget to drink or any other space, you and your partner have to drink. <br />
</p>
<p>Remember, one for all and all for one. If one teammate drinks, both have to. No saying, &quot;You got hooped, or hit, you drink&quot;. Both teammates drink together. </p>
