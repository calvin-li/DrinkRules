<p>Any number of people can play Hi-Lo but only two participate at a time, one dealer and one player. The dealer turns over the top card of the deck to start. The player must then guess whether the next card will be higher or lower than the face-up card.</p>
<p>Each card turned up is placed in a discard pile. If correct the player and dealer switch roles. If wrong the player must take as many drinks as there are cards in the discard pile. If after guessing higher or lower the next card turned up matches the top card on the pile, the player drinks twice the total of the cards in the discard pile. Needless to say this is a bad thing for the player and quite amusing to everyone else.</p>
