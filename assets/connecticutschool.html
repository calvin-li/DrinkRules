  <strong>Materials:</strong><br />
  1 large table<br />
  26 large solo cups<br />
  4 people (2 teams of 2) 2 pingpong balls</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Divide into teams of two. Set up 6 cups in front of each person (there will be four 6racks on the table) two on each side. They are set up in a triangle formation with three in back two in the middle and one cup in the front all tightly together. The other two are used for water cups.<br />
</p>
<p>2. New team on the table gets one ball to throw to start off with. Once that is thrown the previous winners have both balls after and attempt to shoot. If it is the first game decided who starts.<br />
</p>
<p>3. You can shoot at either rack on the opposite side of the table but it is proper etiquette to shoot at the rack directly in front of you.<br />
</p>
<p>4. If you sink a ball in a cup, whoever's cup that is must remove it and drink it before their next throw. If the other person on your team sinks their ball in the same cup (double cupping) then the game is over.</p>
<p>That is why it is important for the person to remove the cup as soon as it is hit.</p>
<p>5. If both people on a team sink both their shots, they get the balls back and another chance to shoot, until only one person makes it or they both miss.<br />
</p>
<p>6. Each of the 6 racks are racked at 4 (diamond shape), three (triangle shape), two (one in front of the other), and one. At anytime if their are a total of 6 cups on one side (as in 6 cups have been hit by the other team). Then you switch to one 6 cup center rack. You will rack this as stated before.<br />
</p>
<p>7. To win you must either double cup it, or sink the ball in all of the other teams cups. Which ever team looses all their cups first, gets one rebuttal shot (really good for the close games). If they sink this shot, then the other team must drink that beer. If the other team has just one cup and it is hit with the rebuttal shot, then you go to over time. The losers must drink the rest of the winners beer.<br />
</p>
<p>8. Overtime: the setup is decided between the players who are playing, they can play another game, but with more beer in each cup, one six rack with three beers in it, or one three cup rack with a beer per cup.<br />
</p>
<p>As soon as the ball hits something (person, table, cup) it can be swatted away, but if it bounces into a cup after touching something, it still counts.<br />
</p>
<p>There is no blowing the ball out of the cup, even if you are a girl.<br />
</p>
<p>If a cup is knocked over and when you pick it up there is still beer in it, it goes back on the table (so pick it up fast). If there is no beer in it, it is taken away. If it is overtime, then it is put back on the table (if there is beer in it) but a full beer is added to the cup, even if you have less in the others.<br />
