  1. Each team begins with 10 cups arranged in a triangle. (4 in the back, 3 in the next row, 2, then 1 at the top) Filled up 1/3 of the way with either beer or liquor. <br />
</p>
<p>2. Typically, the two teams will shoot to see who goes first. <br />
</p>
<p>3. Once a cup is made, it's content's must be drank by the opposing team (Whether it be beer or occasionally hard liquor) and then removed from <br />
  the table. <br />
</p>
<p>4. Players continue to shoot at each other's cups until none remain. The losing team must drink the remaining cups from the winning team. </p>
<p>5. At any time during the game, a team may request to have the opposing team's cups rearranged in any formation they choose. This is only allowed <br />
  once. <br />
</p>
<p>6. If a ball is bounced, it counts as 2 cups. However, the opposing team may knock the ball away after it bounces off the table once. <br />
</p>
<p>7. If a ball hits off of a player and falls into a cup, it counts. <br />
</p>
<p>8. If two members of an opposing team make both of they're shots, the balls are returned to that team. There is no limit how many times balls may be returned to them. <br />
</p>
<p>9. After the last cup is made, the opposing team has two shots to keep the <br />
  game going. This is called a &quot;rebuttal&quot;. If that team makes one cup, both balls are returned to the original team and the game continues. </p>
