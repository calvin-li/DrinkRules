<p>1. Line cups up 6 on each side (other 2 are to wash balls off) - line up starting with 3 then 2 then 1 kind of like bowling pins<br />
</p>
<p>2. You can either bounce it in or throw it in the cup <br />
</p>
<p>3. Ball goes in cup opposite team has to drink the cup . <br />
</p>
<p>4. Both members of the team shoot , if both players on the same team make it in they get the balls back and get a chance to do it again. Whoever has cups left wins the game and the winner stays. </p>
<p>5. Side notes - after 2 bounces you may block the shot and are aloud to try to blow the ball out of the cup with your mouth. If a cup is knocked off the table the opposing team has to drink it . </p>
