<p>Just one film or the whole trilogy?  Your call.  Depends if you have someplace to be the next day.</p>
<p>Below are abridged rules to Flick Filosopher's very funny, surreal epic drinking (and, often, non-drinking) game.</p>
<p>Our advice: start with <em>Fellowship</em>, see how you get on.  If you're in it for the long-haul, try Flick's full version.</p>
<p><strong>THE RULES</strong></p>
<p>Drink Every Time . . .</p>
<p>- Someone drinks anything.  If it's a Hobbit, drink twice; if it's Gimli, three times.  If Gimli belches afterward, drink the whole bottle.<br />
  - Someone eats anything.  If it's a Hobbit, twice.  If it's an Orc eating entrails, take a third drink.<br />
  - A Hobbit talks about food.<br />
  - Frodo says &quot;Oh, Sam!&quot;<br />
  - Aragorn and Boromir have an argument.<br />
  - Someone looks all mopey and angst-ridden.  If it's Frodo, drink again.<br />
  - A Black Rider appears.<br />
  - We see someone's filthy, chewed-up fingernails.<br />
  - Someone sings a song.<br />
  - You can tell the camera was mounted on a helicopter.<br />
  - Someone draws a sword.<br />
  - Pippin acts like an idiot.<br />
  - Legolas looks fabulous.<br />
  - Frodo's eyes roll back into his head.<br />
  - Gollum hacks up a &quot;gollum! gollum!&quot;<br />
  - Someone or something is called &quot;precious.&quot;<br />
  - Someone consults a map.<br />
  - You speak along with the dialogue.</p>
