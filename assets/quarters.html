<p><strong>Supplies</strong>: people and beer (as usual), a quarter (hence the name), and a shallow juice-type glass. </p>
<p>All players sit around a table, or similarly hard surface, and, in turn, try to bounce the quarter off the table into the juice glass. If successful, the player tells any other player to have a drink, as well as receiving another turn. If the player fails, play passes to the next in the circle. </p>
<p>If the player is fortunate enough to make three bounces in a row, this player may make a rule. Anything goes. Some favorites are: </p>
<p>&quot;Can't say drink, drank, or drunk.&quot;<br/>
  &quot;Can't point with your fingers.&quot;<br/>
  &quot;No proper names.&quot;<br/>
  &quot;Have a drink before each attempted bounce.&quot; etc. (be creative) </p>
<p>If any rule is broken during the course of play, the violator subsequently &quot;consumes some beverage.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Early days variations: </strong></p>
<p>The glass that you bounce into also contains the beer to drink. The trick is to then drink the beer without swallowing the quarter. </p>
<p>If the player bounces and hits the rim of the glass, without the quarter going in, s/he receives another free attempt. </p>
<p>If the player misses, and feels confident enough, s/he may &quot;chance&quot; for another attempt. If the player makes the chance attempt, things proceed as if it were a normal turn. However, if the chance attempt fails, that player must drink the beer. </p>
<p>Following a failed &quot;chance&quot; attempt, the player may wish to attempt a &quot;kill.&quot; if the attempt is successful, play continues as </p>
<p>normal, but if the attempt fails, the player must drink a full glass/ can/bottle of beer non- stop. </p>
