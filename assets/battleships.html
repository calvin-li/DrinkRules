<h2>Setup Instructions</h2>
<p>To setup this game, organise two rows of 4 cups with a gap of around a foot in between them. Each player takes one coin as ammo.</p>
<h2>Game Requirements</h2>
<p>The Battleships game will require you to have 2 quarters (or any suitable coin alternative) and 8 cups.</p>
<h2>How To Play</h2>
<p>The aim of this drinking game is to eliminate your opposite player's Battleships before they sink yours. To sink a ship, you need to take turns in bouncing your coin off your Battleship and into your opponents. If you take out an opponent’s Battleship, they must drink the contents of the cup and remove it from the game. If a player makes their own cup or fails to clear their battleship with the bounce, they must drink their cup and refill it.</p>
<h2>Additions</h2>
<p>There are none. Can you think of any good additions for Battleships?</p>
