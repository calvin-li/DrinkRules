<p><strong>Dazed And Confused</strong></p>
<p>The nearest American college culture has to a <em>Withnail &amp; I</em>, Richard Linklater's blissed-out 'last day of school' movie revolves around kegs of beer, spliffs and random violence meted out against younger kids.</p>
<p>Various games are available, but Barmeister wins out for attempting to combine them all with a view to making that title all too literal.</p>
<p><strong>THE RULES</strong></p>
<p>Drink Every Time . . .</p>
<p>- Someone is paddled<br />
  - There's reference to a &quot;sixer&quot;<br />
  - Slater says &quot;fuck&quot; and &quot;wasted&quot; in the same sentence<br />
  - Someone says &quot;Shotgun&quot;<br />
  - Someone in the movie drinks<br />
  - Someone talks about, sells, buys, smokes, or refers to marijuana<br />
  - Someone gives Randy &quot;Pink&quot; the drug-free pledge paper<br />
  - Mitch rubs his nose</p>
<p>Barmeister also recommends an 'intense buzz' option of taking a drink every time somebody says, 'Man,' but by our reckoning you'll be comatose by the half-hour mark.</p>
